## TODO

* Sort out notes on static versus dynamic metaprogramming
* Ruby metaprogramming seems to be a sort of "patterns language" for macros? 
How would each metaprogramming construct in Ruby be implemented in CL?
* Examine the LOOP and iterate libraries in CL. Compare with 
Ruby's each, inject, map, find (array and AR), etc. The iterate 
library may be an add on library.

A small amount of math: \\(\forall x \in X\\)

Rails helpers for macro examples.
