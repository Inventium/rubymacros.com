## Summary

### References and required reading

* [Programming Ruby 1.9](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9) 
Chapter 24 on metaprogramming has excellent
examples of how macros are defined and used in Ruby.

* Paul Graham's [On Lisp](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf) 
should be required reading for all Rubyists regardless of any interest in 
Ruby macros. It's that important. And it's free to download a PDF file 
of the book. Do all the examples, by hand.

* Peter Seibel's [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) is available online.

* Ola Bini

* Interesting [RSpec macro thread](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2011-August/020463.html)

Macros: I know them when I see them.

Rails helpers.


#### About

This micro-project came about as the result of a Google search.
After wading through pages of meaningless search results, 
cloned and swiped web pages, blog posts parroting the 
same old-same old, one of the authors found himself 
emitting Chewbacca-style roars of frustration.  A little
SEO juju and snapped up the exact match domain, to wit:
rubymacros.com, and a vow to set the matter straight once 
and for all, with some links to the best available pages
on the web. Curation doncha know.

## TODO

* Sort out notes on static versus dynamic metaprogramming
* Ruby metaprogramming seems to be a sort of "patterns language" for macros? 
How would each metaprogramming construct in Ruby be implemented in CL?
* Examine the LOOP and iterate libraries in CL. Compare with 
Ruby's each, inject, map, find (array and AR), etc. The iterate 
library may be an add on library.
