#### About

This micro-project came about as the result of a Google search.
After wading through pages of meaningless search results, 
cloned and swiped web pages, blog posts parroting the 
same old-same old, one of the authors found himself 
emitting Chewbacca-style roars of frustration.  A little
SEO juju and snapped up the exact match domain, to wit:
rubymacros.com, and a vow to set the matter straight once 
and for all, with some links to the best available pages
on the web. Curation doncha know.

## TODO

* Sort out notes on static versus dynamic metaprogramming
* Ruby metaprogramming seems to be a sort of "patterns language" for macros? 
How would each metaprogramming construct in Ruby be implemented in CL?
* Examine the LOOP and iterate libraries in CL. Compare with 
Ruby's each, inject, map, find (array and AR), etc. The iterate 
library may be an add on library.
