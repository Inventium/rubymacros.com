## Summary

In the end, we're not really sure whether Ruby has "real" macros or not.

We are sure that Ruby allows construction of methods which behave
identically to text substitution macros, and that adding parse tree
substitution would require a bit of syntax hackerage.



### References and required reading

* [Programming Ruby 1.9](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9) 
Chapter 24 on metaprogramming has excellent
examples of how macros are defined and used in Ruby.

* Paul Graham's [On Lisp](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf) 
should be required reading for all Rubyists regardless of any interest in 
Ruby macros. It's that important. And it's free to download a PDF file 
of the book. Do all the examples, by hand.

* Peter Seibel's [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) is available online.

* Ola Bini writes thoughtful articles on
macros and more at [Programming Language
Synchronicity](http://olabini.com/blog/).

* Interesting [RSpec macro thread](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2011-August/020463.html)

#### About

This micro-project came about as the result of a Google search.
After wading through pages of meaningless search results, 
cloned and swiped web pages, blog posts parroting the 
same old-same old, one of the authors found himself 
emitting Chewbacca-style roars of frustration.  A little
SEO juju and snapped up the exact match domain, to wit:
rubymacros.com, and a vow to set the matter straight once 
and for all, with some links to the best available pages
on the web. Curation doncha know.
